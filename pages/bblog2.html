					<h2>Adam in Italy</h2>
					<p>What do you think of when you think of Italy?</p><img class="blog-pic" src="photos/kronish_blog.jpg">
					<p>Hi, my name is Adam Kronish and I’m a brother of Theta Chi Fraternity, Epsilon Theta chapter at Tufts University. I’m currently spending my Fall semester abroad in a Direct Enrollment Program at Universita’ degli Studi di Perugia in Italy. Most people answer the question like so: pizza, cappuccino, wine, food, mafia, Godfather, spaghetti and meatballs, Leaning Tower of Pisa, gladiators, gondola, and so many more. And believe me, before studying the Italian culture and language in high school, at Tufts, and beyond I would have said the same things. But now that I’m halfway through my semester in Italy, my answer to this question has drastically changed. Don’t get me wrong, the food, wine, and coffee here are to die for. The mafia does exist and does have a prominent influence (I’m taking an entire course dedicated to it). The Leaning Tower of Pisa is, in fact a tower that is leaning…in Pisa.</p>
					<p>I came to Italy with many goals, but I want to address two of them in particular: (1) reach a level of fluency with the language and (2) travel to all of the places that I’ve learned about in the past 8 years of studying Italian.</p>
					<p>If you want to learn a language, you need to live where people speak it. From living here, I’ve learned phrases of Italian and Perugian dialect that I would never have learned in a classroom in the U.S. I’m even taking 2 courses at the Italian university here that are dedicated to teaching me the differences in Italian in different types of writing (poetry vs. prose vs. journalism vs. legislation) and the history of the Italian language. From classes, you can learn all of the verb tenses (don’t get me started on congiuntivo) and memorize all of the vocab you can fit in your head, but you never know what is actually useful until you’ve lived where a language is spoken. As far as traveling, I have been to at least 10 Italian cities so far, and each one is as unique as the next. Italy’s regions have different characteristics based on where they are geographically. You can’t learn about Italy’s culture as a whole in a classroom because, in reality, it doesn’t exist. Each region, each providence, each city is different from one another, so drastically that it’s impossible to even make generalizations about a region. One more thing I want to mention, before I end this blog post, is that Theta Chi is always present for a brother, even if he’s on the other side of the ocean. I’ve even ran into 2 other brothers from different chapters since I’ve been here!</p>
					<p>Infine, grazie per aver letto tutto quello che avevo scritto, e spero che tutti possano avere un’esperienza all’estero come la mia. [To close, thanks for reading everything that I’ve written and I hope that everyone can have an experience abroad like mine.]</p>
